# 🌀 Meta-Mandelbrot Explorations

<img width="2902" height="2966" alt="meta_mandelbrot_final" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01fa5b21-ae1d-4660-a63d-1eee15e2b1a1" />

A visual experiment exploring **Mandelbrot set variants** generated by changing the starting value z₀ ≠ 0.

This repository contains Python scripts that investigate how the Mandelbrot set behaves when the iteration starts from different complex values z₀ instead of the usual z₀ = 0. Each script offers a different angle on this meta-structure of Mandelbrots.

## 🔧 Installation

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tqdm
```

---

## 📁 Contents

### `meta_mandelbrot.py`

> 🔹 Generates a large grid of actual mini Mandelbrot sets — one for each z₀ value.

- Each tile in the grid is a full Mandelbrot set, computed starting from a specific `z₀`.
- This gives an intuitive view of how the familiar shape warps, splits, or collapses as z₀ varies.
- Parameters like grid size and panel resolution are configurable.

📄 Output: `meta_mandelbrot.png`

### `meta_mandelbrot_with_axes.py`

> 🔹 Computes a single meta-level image: **each pixel represents a unique z₀**, and its color indicates how stable the corresponding Mandelbrot set is.

- Instead of showing each set visually, it uses a scoring method.
- The score represents the **fraction of c-values** in the complex plane for which the orbit remains bounded (i.e. in the Mandelbrot set).
- The result is a scalar map of "Mandelbrot stability" across the z₀-plane.

📄 Output: `meta_mandelbrot_with_axes.png`

### `mandelbrot_variants_grid.py`

> 🔹 Similar to `meta_mandelbrot.py`, but focuses on **visual clarity** of how individual Mandelbrot sets differ with z₀.

- It uses a smaller number of z₀ values but much higher resolution per tile.
- Useful to closely observe how the standard Mandelbrot structure morphs as z₀ changes.
- This script is for **exploratory understanding**, not to generate the meta-structure.

📄 Output: `meta_mandelbrot_panels.png`

## ✨ Idea

This project explores a kind of **meta-space of Mandelbrot sets** — each point in the z₀-plane gives rise to a new variant of the set. By rendering them either directly or via stability scores, we can start to understand how the structure behaves globally.

Inspired by fractals, complex dynamics, and a lot of curiosity.
